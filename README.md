# BusTrac
This excersice tracks the bus stops from the MIT campus to Harvard campus. The marker will move across the map and stop at each bus stop between the two campuses.

How to Run: Once the page loads click on the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button to see the marker move to each bus stop. You should be able to load the index.html file on your own browser.

Future Improvements: Work on improving my coding. Loading different markers. Work up to show real time tracking!
